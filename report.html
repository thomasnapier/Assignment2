<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong>Developed collaboration and communication skills, Completed required sections on time</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong>Lack of communication, Lack of consistent group meetings, Different committment levels, Aaron and Sam mostly left it to the last week</p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong>Learned how to effectively make a website responsive, learned that the capabilities of javascript and jquery are expansive and complex</p>

<h2>Peer Assessment by Thomas Napier</h2>
<p>As directed by Dianna Hardy</p>
<p>I sent an email outlining some issues with my group's efforts and Dianna told me to include it in the report.</p>
<p>Aaron Lanksey put in minimal effort and the things he produced, I feel like were not up to the same standard as the rest of the site. I even offered to take him through my code and explain how I did the things that I did, but he said he knew how it worked when he clearly doesn't.<br>
Sam Sheppard needed heavy assistance when it came to his sections to the point where I was pretty much doing it for him. <br>
Both members left their entire assigned sections to the last minute, degrading the overall quality. I feel like this will impact my mark since its based on overall quality and completeness. I tried to give them an equal amount of work but they just couldn't do it.</p>

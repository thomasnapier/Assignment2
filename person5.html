    Raymond went onto study conducting at the University of Melbourne as a pupil of the late John Hopkins and received further training in the Symphony Australia Young Development Programme.
    He then became the Music Director of the Victorian Youth Symphony Orchestra and Victoria Chorale, soon becoming the Founding Director of Orchestra 21.<br><br>
    He has appeared as a Guest Conductor for the Melbourne Chamber Orchestra, the Port Fairy Music Festival, Stonnington Symphony, among others including the Barrier Reef Orchestra.
    The Great Barrier Reef has had Raymond as a Guest many times since 2011, not only conducting the Orchestra, but also performing as a piano soloist.</p>
